This is the repository for the postgraduate course Stochastic Processes & Optimization in Machine Learning.
The 2023 course included the following exercises provided as Jupyter Notebooks:

 1. Linear Regression, Polynomial Regression and Logistic Regression
 2. K-means Clustering, Principal Component Analysis (PCA), Self-Organized Maps (SOM) and Autoencoders
 3. Markov Chains and Simulation (heavily based on the Stochastic Processes course of the 6th semester in ECE NTUA)
 4. The Metropolis-Hastings Algorithm, Simulated Annealing
 5. Restricted Boltzmann Machine (RBM) and Deep Belief Networks
 6. Markov Decision Processes and Q-Learning
 7. Bellman-Ford Algorithm (Application in the BGP protocol)
 8. Radial Basis Function (RBF), Support Vector Machine (SVM)
 9. Naive Bayes Classifier (Application in DNS DDoS Cyberattack protection) and K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
10. Decision Trees and Random Forests
11. Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM), application in Cybersecurity
12. SHAP-based eXplainable AI (XAI) for tree-based classifiers

For anyone interested to re-solve any of these exercises feel free to delete my solution and try out your own :)
